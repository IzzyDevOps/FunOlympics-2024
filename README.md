## 🔨 Development Methodology

### **Why Scrum?**
We chose **Scrum** for this project because it’s like having a well-oiled machine that keeps you moving forward! This agile methodology helped us stay flexible, adapt to changes, and keep the client in the loop throughout the development process. 

### **The Scrum Adventure:**

1. **Requirements Planning:** We kicked off by defining clear, actionable goals. We captured functional and non-functional requirements and built a solid project plan.
   
2. **User Design:** With **Figma**, we crafted beautiful wireframes and prototypes, iterating based on client feedback to ensure the design was perfect for both users and admins.

3. **System Development:** We used **PHP** for the frontend and **JavaScript** for the backend to bring the design to life. Regular updates and client feedback sessions kept the project on track.

4. **System Evaluation:** We tested everything—from user registration to admin functionalities—to ensure everything worked as planned. We checked usability, security, and maintainability.

5. **System Implementation:** We deployed the application using **WampServer** and **Visual Studio Code**. The final product was ready for local testing and client demonstration.
